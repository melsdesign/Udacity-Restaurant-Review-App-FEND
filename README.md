##The aim of this project## was to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 
Make a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. 

It was necessay add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.



##How to lunch the project:
1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 
For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
 For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
2.Run the server in your terminal


3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around see what the updated experience looks like
