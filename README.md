## Project Overview: Stage 1

##Udacity Restaurant Review App##

This is the 6th project for the Front End Developer Nanodegree program
This is a restaurant reviewer application/website,for which I was given a basic repository
For the moment it is built to show just a certain area,an area in the USA
Select the drop down menu and choose an available area
You can see details about the restaurants ,if you choose to view more you will be able to see the reviews and restaurant location

##The aim of this project## 
was to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. 
Make a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. 

##Service worker added
It was necessay to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.
Everytime you open up the page without a connection you can still see most of the details and the pictures

##How to lunch the project:
#1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 
For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
 
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 
If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
If you have Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

#2.Run the server in your terminal
#3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around see what the updated experience looks like
